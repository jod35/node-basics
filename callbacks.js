//JS is synchronous and single threaded

// //callback functions are those that are executed only when something happens
// for example 

blabla.addEventListener('click',()=>{});

// callback functions are those that are passed into functions to be called if something happens

window.load(()=>{
	//window loaded
	// do something
});
